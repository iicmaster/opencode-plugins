Run an `opencode` review through the shared companion script.

Raw slash-command arguments:
`$ARGUMENTS`

Core constraints:
- This command is review-only. It runs opencode with the read-only `plan` agent.
- Do not fix issues, apply patches, or suggest that you are about to make changes.
- Return the companion stdout verbatim to the user.

Foreground flow:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/oc-companion.mjs" review "$ARGUMENTS"
```

Background flow:

```typescript
Bash({
  command: `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/oc-companion.mjs" review "$ARGUMENTS" --background`,
  description: "opencode review",
  run_in_background: true
})
```

If neither `--wait` nor `--background` is present, prefer foreground for small diffs and background for broad or unclear diffs.
